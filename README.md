# PLEASE HELP

I ran into the issue of cross-origin trying to get the textures for my models... please email/message/etc me if you know how to either bypass this as I can't find a way to run a server instances in a chrome extension.

Thanks

# Mario_Text_Break
Ever wanted Mario to come out and jump break your text for coins?

This Chrome Extension lets you highlight some text and have mario come out to see if there are coins in it


## TODO 

* See if you can add libraries in one script context
* Get models of Mario, coin, etc
* Get Graphic behind and in front of text
* Read where text on page is
